*(Instructions on how to set up and run the project locally will be added here once the initial development is done.)*

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ovuceljic/project-resolution-tracker-app.git
    cd project-resolution-tracker-app
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Frontend (assuming npm)
    cd frontend # or appropriate directory
    npm install

    # Backend setup will involve Supabase project configuration.
    ```
3.  **Configure Supabase:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in your frontend project.
    *   Add your Supabase Project URL and Anon Key:
        ```env
        REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
        REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
